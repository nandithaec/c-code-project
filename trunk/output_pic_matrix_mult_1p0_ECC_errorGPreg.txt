Encoded Content of the location[34] before flipping, is (in hex)401
Content of the location[34] before flipping, is (in hex)80
random_bit=2
Parity bit is flipped, not data bit
Encoded Content of the location[34] after flipping, is (in hex)405
In bit flip(), Bit flipped, Content of the reg[34] was flipped to 82

Bit flipped, Content of the random reg[12] is (in hex) 0

POSSIBLE ERROR: Incorrect data fetched from memory..Need to check if parity/data was in error.
PC value= 306, opcode= 92
Before error correction, content of the reg location 12 was: 0
After error correction, content of the reg location 12 was: 0

Unique error corrected: Incorrect data was being fetched from memory
PC value (in hex)=306, instruction opcode being executed (in hex)=92
Number of instruction cycles executed before the error: 2289950

******Unique errors so far= 26. Repeated errors are counted but not printed******

Flip function called: Random number generated: 78
Encoded Content of the location[8a] before flipping, is (in hex)1a07
Content of the location[8a] before flipping, is (in hex)3
random_bit=11
Parity bit is flipped, not data bit
Encoded Content of the location[8a] after flipping, is (in hex)1207
In bit flip(), Bit flipped, Content of the reg[8a] was flipped to 3
***********************************************************************

Crash number:3 detected
Program crash was due to PC value at location 8a getting affected
Actual PC value (in hex)=38e, instruction opcode that was getting executed (in hex)=3026
Random number that got generated this time was: 78
Time of crash number 3 is 1334221901 seconds since January 1, 1970
At crash 3,time since the beginning of program execution is: 169 (in seconds)
Number of instruction cycles executed before the crash: 2303980

***STARTING ERROR CORRECTION ON PC REG LOCATIONS***
SINGLE ERROR, can be corrected
Bit in error is 2 and is a parity bit. ****DATA BIT NOT IN ERROR****

ERROR CORRECTION: Corrected PC values (location 2 and 82 are PCL, location A and 8A are PCLATH) are:
GP_Reg[0x02] = 8e, GP_Reg[0x82] = 8e, GP_Reg[0x0A] = 3, GP_Reg[0x8A] = 3
