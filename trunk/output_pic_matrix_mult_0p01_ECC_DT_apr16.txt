Crash Avoided number:1 
Program crash would have been due to PC value at location 82 getting affected
Actual PC value (in hex)=3b5, instruction opcode that was getting executed (in hex)=800
Random number that got generated this time was: 9924
Time of crash number 1 is 1334603168 seconds since January 1, 1970

***STARTING ERROR CORRECTION ON PC REG LOCATIONS***
SINGLE ERROR, can be corrected
Bit in error is 10 and is a data bit. NEEDS ERROR CORRECTION.

ERROR CORRECTION: Corrected PC values (location 2 and 82 are PCL, location A and 8A are PCLATH) are:
GP_Reg[0x02] = b5, GP_Reg[0x82] = b5, GP_Reg[0x0A] = 3, GP_Reg[0x8A] = 3
