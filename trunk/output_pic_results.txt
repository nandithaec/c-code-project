Crash number:1
Program crash due to PC value at location 2 getting affected
Time of crash number 1 is 1333107103 seconds since January 1, 1970
At crash 1,time since the beginning of program execution is: 69 (in seconds)
Number of instruction cycles executed before the crash: 149378513

Total number of instructions in the program = 15
Each instruction takes 1 instruction cycles, i.e., 1 clock cycle
Status register contents:(hex) at the end of all operations: 0
Number of instruction cycles executed before each crash:
149378513
Seconds elapsed before each crash: 
70
Calculating the number of errors: 
Opcodes at which the errors occurred get accessed every program run and hence repeated once in every 15 opcodes
Instruction cycle at which the errors first occured:
Total number of times each error occured:
Total number of instruction cycles executed:149378513
Total number of crashes:1
Total number of errors: 0
Summing up all errors which repeat every program run,Total number of errors: 0
Total number of successful instruction cycle executions without errors/crashes:149378512

Percentage of successful executions:99.999999

Number of crashes due to Program counter getting manipulated: 1 
Number of crashes due to illegal memory access: 0 
Number of crashes due to illegal opcode: 0 
Total number of errors due to incorrect control flow: 0
Total number of errors due to incorrect data: 0
Mean time to failure in terms of the number of instruction cycles: 149378513
Mean time to failure in terms of seconds: 70
