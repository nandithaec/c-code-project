***********************************************************************

Crash Avoided number:2 
Program crash would have been due to PC value at location 82 getting affected
Actual PC value (in hex)=3d5, instruction opcode that was getting executed (in hex)=7c2
Random number that got generated this time was: 66
Time of crash number 2 is 1334560724 seconds since January 1, 1970
At crash 2,time since the beginning of program execution is: 129 (in seconds)
Number of instruction cycles executed before the crash: 866520

***STARTING ERROR CORRECTION ON PC REG LOCATIONS***
SINGLE ERROR, can be corrected
Bit in error is 12 and is a data bit. NEEDS ERROR CORRECTION.

ERROR CORRECTION: Corrected PC values (location 2 and 82 are PCL, location A and 8A are PCLATH) are:
GP_Reg[0x02] = d5, GP_Reg[0x82] = d5, GP_Reg[0x0A] = 3, GP_Reg[0x8A] = 3
