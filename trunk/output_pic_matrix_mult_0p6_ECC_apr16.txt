Program crash would have been due to PC value at location 82 getting affected
Actual PC value (in hex)=345, instruction opcode that was getting executed (in hex)=2b47
Random number that got generated this time was: 131
Time of crash number 12 is 1334562842 seconds since January 1, 1970
At crash 12,time since the beginning of program execution is: 1037 (in seconds)
Number of instruction cycles executed before the crash: 223573

***STARTING ERROR CORRECTION ON PC REG LOCATIONS***
SINGLE ERROR, can be corrected
Bit in error is 9 and is a data bit. NEEDS ERROR CORRECTION.

ERROR CORRECTION: Corrected PC values (location 2 and 82 are PCL, location A and 8A are PCLATH) are:
GP_Reg[0x02] = 45, GP_Reg[0x82] = 45, GP_Reg[0x0A] = 3, GP_Reg[0x8A] = 3

***PC reset after crash***
PC is reset to its initial values (in hex): PCL=9f, PCLATH=2, PC=29f
***All general purpose registers reset after crash***
***Program memory reset after crash***
***Reloading instructions to program memory***
Maximum number of instructions in the program is: 395

Last valid PC value is (in hex): 3fe

Loaded matrix multiplication program into memory

Instructions read as is, from the file.. not according to increasing order of PC


After error correction, content of the reg location 3a was: 4a
After error correction, encoded content of the reg location 3a was: 1b14
