Crash Avoided number:3 
Program crash would have been due to PC value at location a getting affected
Actual PC value (in hex)=3e9, instruction opcode that was getting executed (in hex)=3001
Random number that got generated this time was: 19922
Time of crash number 3 is 1334687513 seconds since January 1, 1970
At crash 3,time since the beginning of program execution is: 48729 (in seconds)

***STARTING ERROR CORRECTION ON PC REG LOCATIONS***
SINGLE ERROR, can be corrected
Bit in error is 4 and is a parity bit. ****DATA BIT NOT IN ERROR****

ERROR CORRECTION: Corrected PC values (location 2 and 82 are PCL, location A and 8A are PCLATH) are:
GP_Reg[0x02] = e9, GP_Reg[0x82] = e9, GP_Reg[0x0A] = 3, GP_Reg[0x8A] = 3
